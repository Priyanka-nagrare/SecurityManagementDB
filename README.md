# NorthEastNinjas Database Project

This repository contains the SQL scripts and documentation for the NorthEastNinjas database system, designed for a security firm management system. This project is part of the KC7013 Database Modelling course at Northumbria University.

## Project Overview

The project involves designing and implementing a relational database to support the operations of NorthEastNinjas, a security firm that manages security arrangements, staff allocations, and bookings for various sites.

## Database Schema

The schema includes tables for staff, clients, sites, security arrangements, staff assignments, and other necessary entities to support the business operations.

## Setup Instructions

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - Run the `projectsqlscript.sql` to create and initialize the database schema.
   - Ensure to backup any existing data before running the script as it includes DROP TABLE commands.

## Features

- **Data Integrity**: Use of constraints to ensure the reliability of data.
- **Transaction Management**: Ensures all database transactions are processed reliably.
